# Computer Vision Predictive Surveillance System

A real-time computer vision system that combines multi-person tracking, pose
estimation, identity recognition, facial-expression context, gesture analysis,
activity recognition, and independent temporal state management.

The project was developed as an applied artificial intelligence portfolio
piece to explore how multiple computer vision models can be integrated into a
single processing pipeline.

## Project Overview

The system processes live or recorded video and maintains an independent state
for every tracked person.

For each detected person, the application can display:

* a persistent tracking ID
* pose landmarks and skeleton rendering
* enrolled-person identity
* facial-expression context
* human activity classification
* completed right-hand wave count
* current review level
* recent state changes

The application combines spatial model outputs with temporal logic. Individual
detections are not treated as isolated frames. Instead, tracking history,
gesture events, identity agreement, activity sequences, and expression
smoothing are maintained separately for each person.

Face and activity predictions provide context only.
Review levels are determined by repeated-wave rules.
## Key Features

### Multi-Person Detection and Tracking

YOLO Pose and ByteTrack are used to detect and track multiple people.

Each person receives a persistent track ID so that identity, gestures,
activities, expressions, and review state can be maintained independently over
time.

### Pose Estimation

YOLO Pose estimates 17 body keypoints, including:

* shoulders
* elbows
* wrists
* hips
* knees
* ankles

The pose landmarks are used for skeleton visualization, wave detection, and
pose-based activity recognition.

### Identity Recognition

Optional identity recognition uses OpenCV DNN models:

* YuNet for face detection
* SFace for face recognition

Identity confirmation requires agreement across multiple frames. Low-quality
faces are rejected, and confirmed identities expire unless they are
revalidated.

The application continues anonymously when no enrolled identities are
available.

### Facial-Expression Context

MediaPipe is used to locate visible faces within tracked person regions.
EmotiEffLib then estimates facial-expression context.

A rolling smoothing window reduces label flicker. Lower-confidence estimates
can remain visible with a `?` indicator to show that the classification is
tentative.

Expression estimates are informational and do not directly change the
behavior-based review level.

### Repeated-Wave Detection

The system detects completed raised right-hand wave gestures using temporal
pose information.

Wave events are counted within a rolling time window. The first two completed
waves are treated as ordinary activity, while additional repeated waves
increase the review level.

### Review Levels

The application uses four behavior-based review states:

* `CLEAR`: green
* `MONITOR`: yellow
* `REVIEW`: orange
* `HIGH`: red

The review state is based on repeated temporal gesture activity. Identity,
facial expression, and activity classifications remain separate contextual
signals.

### Independent Multi-Person State

Each tracked person has an independent:

* identity state
* wave history
* expression history
* activity sequence
* review level
* event history

One person's activity does not affect the state assigned to another person.

## Human Activity Recognition

The project includes an activity-recognition benchmark for:

* walking
* running
* standing
* sitting

Three approaches were evaluated using the same source-video partitions.

### MLP Pose Model

The MLP uses sequences of normalized YOLO Pose landmarks.

Each sample contains 16 frames of:

* 17 keypoint x-coordinates
* 17 keypoint y-coordinates
* 17 keypoint visibility values

The saved MLP checkpoint can also be enabled in the main application to provide
informational per-person activity labels.

### MobileNetV2

The image-based approach uses cached features extracted from a frozen
ImageNet-pretrained MobileNetV2 backbone.

A four-class linear classification head is trained using the cached features.

### S3D

The advanced video approach uses cached features extracted from a frozen
Kinetics-400-pretrained S3D model.

A four-class linear classification head is trained on the resulting temporal
video features.

## Activity Recognition Results

The models were evaluated using 120 held-out HMDB51 test videos.

| Model       | Accuracy | Macro F1 | Head Training Time | CPU Inference Latency |
| ----------- | -------: | -------: | -----------------: | --------------------: |
| MLP         |   46.67% |   47.00% |            0.219 s |              0.262 ms |
| MobileNetV2 |   47.50% |   46.02% |            0.111 s |              80.73 ms |
| S3D         |   42.50% |   41.35% |            0.065 s |             293.31 ms |

MobileNetV2 achieved the highest accuracy, while the MLP produced the highest
macro F1 and substantially lower inference latency.

The MLP was selected for optional real-time integration because it reuses the
pose landmarks already generated by the tracking pipeline and does not require
an additional image or video backbone during inference.

## System Architecture

The processing pipeline is divided into independent components:

1. Video frame acquisition
2. YOLO Pose person detection
3. ByteTrack identity assignment
4. Pose landmark extraction
5. Gesture-state updates
6. Optional face and identity analysis
7. Facial-expression estimation and smoothing
8. Optional MLP activity inference
9. Per-person temporal state updates
10. Review-level calculation
11. Annotation rendering
12. Structured event logging

The activity model reuses YOLO Pose results already generated by the main
pipeline. It does not run an additional pose model.

## Installation

Python 3.11 or 3.12 is recommended.

Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Install the core dependencies:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Prepare and verify the required model files:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\main.py --doctor --prepare-models
```

On macOS or Linux, replace:

```text
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

with:

```text
.venv/bin/python
```

### Exact Tested Environment

`requirements-tested.txt` records the exact core package versions used during
the July 2026 Windows verification.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-tested.txt
```

### Optional Activity Dependencies

Install the activity-recognition dependencies when training, evaluating, or
using the MLP activity checkpoint:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-activity.txt
```

## Running the Application

Open the application menu:

```powershell
python src/main.py
```

The menu provides options for:

* enrolling identities
* starting real-time processing
* deleting existing enrollments

To start processing directly:

```powershell
python src/main.py --detect --source 0
```

Camera source `0` generally represents the built-in camera. Other camera
indices, video paths, and supported stream sources can also be provided.

Press `q` to close the processing window.

## Processing Recorded Media

Place a supported image or video in the `input` directory:

```powershell
python src/main.py --process-media
```

Annotated files are written to the `output` directory.

Video output names retain the source extension, so `clip.mov` becomes
`clip.mov_annotated.mp4` and `clip.avi` becomes `clip.avi_annotated.mp4`.
This prevents different input formats with the same base name from overwriting
each other. Reprocessing the same input replaces its previous output atomically.

Recorded sources use video timestamps for gesture windows and activity sampling,
with a frame-rate fallback when the decoder does not provide usable timestamps.
Live cameras and streams use monotonic elapsed time.

To process one specific file:

```powershell
python src/main.py --process-media --input "input\sample.mp4"
```

Supported image formats include:

* `.bmp`
* `.jpeg`
* `.jpg`
* `.png`
* `.webp`

Supported video formats include:

* `.avi`
* `.m4v`
* `.mkv`
* `.mov`
* `.mp4`

## Enabling Live Activity Recognition

Newly prepared activity caches and checkpoints use a shared source-time sampling
interval. See [activity preprocessing and checkpoint compatibility](docs/activity_preprocessing.md)
for rebuild commands and legacy checkpoint behavior.

Train the activity models first:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\train_activity_models.py
```

The default MLP checkpoint is generated at:

```text
data/activity_models/mlp.pt
```

Enable the saved MLP checkpoint:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\main.py --detect --source 0 `
  --activity-model mlp `
  --activity-checkpoint "data\activity_models\mlp.pt"
```

The activity recognizer:

* waits for 16 valid pose frames
* performs inference every five frames by default
* smooths the five most recent probability vectors
* displays low-confidence predictions as `Unknown`
* stores separate pose and prediction histories for each tracked person

## Activity Benchmark

Prepare the HMDB51 data:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\prepare_activity_data.py `
  --dataset-root "data\hmdb51\hmdb51_org" `
  --annotations-root "data\hmdb51\splits"
```

Train and evaluate all three models:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\train_activity_models.py
```

Evaluate existing checkpoints without retraining:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\evaluate_activity_models.py
```

Generated results are written to:

```text
output/activity_results/
```

The generated files include:

* `metrics.json`
* `model_comparison.csv`
* `predictions.csv`
* `mlp_confusion_matrix.png`
* `cnn_confusion_matrix.png`
* `advanced_confusion_matrix.png`
* `training_curves.png`
* `run_manifest.json`

## Validation

Copy the example validation manifest:

```powershell
Copy-Item validation\manifest.example.json validation\manifest.json
```

Add consented validation media under:

```text
validation/media/
```

Run the validation framework:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\main.py --validate `
  --manifest validation\manifest.json `
  --report validation\reports\latest.json
```

The validation runner measures:

* number of people detected
* confirmed identities
* review-state counts
* processing performance
* scenario acceptance criteria

## Testing

Install both the core and optional activity dependencies before running the
complete test suite:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-activity.txt
```

Check dependency consistency:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip check
```

Compile the source and tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q src tests
```

Run all tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The test suite covers temporal state, model loading, preprocessing, media export,
and event reporting. Run it in your installed environment to verify compatibility.

CI also checks Python lint rules configured in `pyproject.toml`. To run them locally:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install ruff==0.16.7
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check --config pyproject.toml src scripts tests
```

Install the repository as an editable Python project:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
```

## Model Provisioning

The application automatically downloads several required models when they are
not present locally.

Downloads use:

* pinned upstream revisions
* expected SHA-256 checksums
* temporary download files
* atomic file replacement
* configurable retry behavior

Prepare all downloadable models:

```powershell
python src/main.py --doctor --prepare-models
```

Verify operation without allowing new downloads:

```powershell
python src/main.py --doctor --no-model-downloads
```

The MediaPipe face detector model at
`data/blaze_face_short_range.tflite` is stored in the repository because it is
loaded directly by the expression-analysis component.

Other downloaded model files are excluded from version control.

## Design Considerations

### Temporal Processing

Many computer vision systems evaluate each frame independently. This project
uses temporal state to support:

* repeated-gesture detection
* identity confirmation
* identity expiration
* expression smoothing
* pose-sequence activity recognition
* review-level progression
* stale-track cleanup

### Shared Pose Inference

The activity-recognition system does not run YOLO Pose a second time.

The existing pose results are reused for:

* skeleton rendering
* wave detection
* activity feature generation

This reduces redundant computation.

### Independent Track State

State is keyed by the persistent tracking ID. This prevents one person's
identity, activity, expression, or gesture history from being assigned to
another person.

### Offline Reproducibility

The project supports offline verification after model preparation through:

```powershell
python src/main.py --doctor --no-model-downloads
```

Datasets, generated checkpoints, feature caches, reports, and output media are
kept outside Git version control.

## Limitations

* Activity recognition was evaluated using a limited four-class subset of
  HMDB51.
* The benchmark contained 120 held-out test videos.
* Performance may change under different lighting, camera angles, clothing,
  movement speeds, occlusion, and environmental conditions.
* Facial-expression estimates do not establish a person's intent or emotional
  state.
* Identity recognition depends on enrollment quality and visible facial
  features.
* Review levels are demonstration-oriented behavioral indicators and are not
  security conclusions.
* The benchmark models were not trained end to end.
* MobileNetV2 and S3D use frozen pretrained feature extractors.
* Real-world deployment would require broader validation, privacy review,
  fairness analysis, security controls, and legal assessment.

## Responsible Use

This project is intended for academic evaluation, technical experimentation,
and portfolio presentation.

It does not determine whether a person is suspicious, dangerous, or engaged in
wrongdoing.

Pose, identity, expression, and activity predictions can be incorrect or
affected by:

* lighting
* camera placement
* occlusion
* image quality
* appearance
* disability
* environmental conditions
* model and dataset limitations

Any real-world application would require:

* informed consent
* appropriate data governance
* human oversight
* access controls
* bias and fairness evaluation
* privacy protection
* compliance with applicable laws and organizational policies
